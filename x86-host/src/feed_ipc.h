// Everything heavy stays on the GPU. WHICH SIDE CREATES the four shared textures
// depends on the game's API, and the driver decides, not us:
//
//  * D3D11 client (client_kind = FEED_CLIENT_D3D11, protocol v1's only case): the
//    game creates them on D3D11 -- the direction the driver accepts, see the
//    phase-0 spike -- and sends its local NT-handle values; the host duplicates
//    them out of the game process and opens them on D3D12.
//  * OpenGL client (client_kind = FEED_CLIENT_GL) and Vulkan client
//    (FEED_CLIENT_VULKAN): the HOST creates them on D3D12 and duplicates the
//    handles INTO the game, which imports them as GL textures / VkImages. For GL
//    the direction is forced -- GL memory objects are import-only, so a GL process
//    cannot export one (PLAN-OPENGL §5, design A). For Vulkan it is forced the
//    other way round: D3D12 cannot open Vulkan-exported memory. Either way it is
//    the better direction, since the resource is then born with exactly the D3D12
//    flags NGX wants.
//
// Either way the host creates the two shared fences on D3D12 and duplicates them
// INTO the game process. The pipe carries only these fixed-size structs.
//
// Sync per frame n: game copies inputs, Signal(in_fence, n), sends FeedFrameMsg,
// records Wait(out_fence, n) + blit; host waits in_fence >= n, evaluates,
// Signal(out_fence, n). A pipe break on either side means "stop feeding".
//
// Version 2 added client_kind and the host-created texture handles. Version 3 added
// FEED_CLIENT_VULKAN and FeedBuildAck::output_fmt -- when the host creates the
// textures it also OWNS the output-format choice (the typed-UAV-store fallback needs
// a D3D12 device to ask), and the game must know the real format to import the
// VkImage and to decide copy-vs-blit for the way home.
//
// Both sides refuse a version they do not understand rather than misparsing it: the
// struct sizes differ between versions, so a mismatched pair would desync the pipe.
